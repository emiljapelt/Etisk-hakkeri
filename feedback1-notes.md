how does permission work in serenity
memory seperation between processes

read about, spectre and meltdown

literature: google scholar, linux CVEs

Look at previous exploits in serenity 

look at darwin macos or bsd

drivers tend to operate at kernel level, but less maintained

most important, process and technique
secondary, find something and dislose

goal is find exploit in linux, but with serenity as a proxy / toy project
